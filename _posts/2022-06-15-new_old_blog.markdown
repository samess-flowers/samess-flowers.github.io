Everything old is new again.  New job, new city, new blog.

I'll start by re-introducing myself.  My name is Sam Ess.  I work in IT in New York City.  I write code, mostly Python when I can manage it, Bash when I can't avoid it, and Powershell when I'm lost and wander into Windows territory.  I work in the Mac management space, using Jamf Pro for most of the manage-y bits.  I like writing little tools to solve little problems.

The projects I'm currently looking to start are some Slackbot things, some media server things, and some Mosyle things.  So look out for those things, I guess.  I hope to update this blog at least weekly, but more likely will never post an update.
