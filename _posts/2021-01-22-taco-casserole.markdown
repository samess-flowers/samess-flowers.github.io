I can cook just about one thing, and it's this.  It's based on a recipe I grabbed from online, which for some reason had Doritos (tm) as a kind of crust, which was disgusting.  It's quick, filling, resembles healthy if you squint, and is cheap, I love it.

### Ingredients
* 1 pound 90/10 ground beef
* 1 15 oz can black beans
* 1 15 oz can pinto beans
* 1 15 oz can corn
* 400 g shredded cheese
* 2 cups salsa (approximate)

### Spices
* Salt
* Garlic powder
* Onion powder
* Cumin
* Chili powder
* Cayenne pepper

### Recipe
0. Set oven to 350 and do the rest while it pre-heats
1. Crumble beef into chunks and cook over medium heat in a large pan
2. Just go apeshit with the spices on the beef, you can't have too much
3. De-can beans and corn, drain in colander
4. Mix salsa, beans, corn, and 150 g of cheese together (not in the colander, in a bowl).  You want a pretty thick consistency so go easy on the salsa
5. The beef should be cooked by now, if not, wait until it's done
6. Mix everything together in that pan and let it get warm.  Lower heat
7. Once the oven's done preheating, throw the mix in a big casserole dish and cover with the remaining cheese
8. Bake for 25 minutes
9. Done!  You can throw it in the fridge and it'll keep for a week.
