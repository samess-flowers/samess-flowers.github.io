This recipe is adapted from the book _Half Baked Harvest: Super Simple_ by Tieghan Gerard.  That version had potatoes in it, which completely throws off all the cooking times (and isn't as good).  The choice of peppers will determine how the spice level.

## Ingredients
1. 1 medium yellow onion, chopped
1. 1 28 oz. can crushed tomoatoes
1. EITHER:
    1. Regular spicy: 16 oz jar of fire roasted red peppers, drained and chopped (pasta aisle)
    1. Ultra spicy: 7 oz can of chipotle peppers in Adobo sauce, drained and chopped (Mexican aisle)
1. 8 eggs
1. 8 oz shredded cheddar or Mexican cheese 
1. Some kind of cooking oil

## Spices
1. Chipotle chile powder
1. Regular chile powder
1. Smoked paprika
1. Seasoned salt
1. Cilantro

## Recipe
1. Heat up the oil in a pan on medium heat.  When the oil shimmers, add the onions and cook until softened for ~8 minutes.  Stir in chile powders, paprika, and salt, then cook for another minute
1. Add tomatoes, peppers.  Increase heat to medium-high until boiling, then reduce to medium and simmer for about 10 minutes.  A splatter guard is HIGHLY recommended, but a lid cocked at an angle (to release steam) works in a pinch.  Add spices to taste.
1. Crack eggs into pan, do your best to keep the yolk intact.  Cover the mixture with the cheese.  Cover the skillet with a lid and cook until the egg whites are solid, normally around 8-12 minutes, you just gotta watch it or be fine with hard boiled eggs.
1. Top with cilantro and some more cheese to serve.
