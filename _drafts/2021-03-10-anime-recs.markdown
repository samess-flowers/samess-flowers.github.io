A coworker new to the scene recently asked for anime recommendations.  I've got five recommendations, each in a different category.  These are short (the longest is 26 30 minute episodes, the shortest is just a movie), easy to find, and have ties to lead you to other excellent things to watch.  Also, each of these shows is available with a "dub", which is the anime jargon for "English voiceover".  In one case, *Cowboy Bebop*, the dub is the definitive way to watch it, in others, *Girls und Panzer* in particular, it's merely serviceable.  Some people may look down on you for not watching it in the original Japanese ("subs" in the jargon), but those people are wrong.

# Something classic: Cowboy Bebop
If you're going to watch one anime, ever, it should be this.  *Cowboy Bebop* is a classic for a reason.  It's got everything: comedy, drama, cowboys, crime, neat guns, great characters, and an amazing soundtrack.  The basic premise is that it's the future, but not some beautiful Star Trek future, it's a grody used up future where everything is broken.  A core cast of five characters comprises the crew of the Bebop, a spaceship that travels the solar system seeking bounties to catch.  

If you like *Cowboy Bebop*, the creator went on to make *Samurai Champloo* and *Space Dandy*.  If you like all the neat guns, check out *Jormangund* or *Gunsmith Cats*!  If you want more canonized 90's classics, watch *Neon Genesis Evangelion*, *Ghost in the Shell*, or *Jin-Roh: The Wolf Brigade*.

*Cowboy Bebop* is available on Blu-Ray and streaming on Funimation and Hulu!

# Something funny: Nichijou (My Ordinary Life)
*Nichijou* is an absurdist comedy by Keichi Arawi focusing on the surreal moments that make up everyone's life.  The animation is top notch, taking many cues from action shows even though this is ostensibly a slice of life.  The show borders on sketch comedy, with each episode having several "plots" woven together.  Despite all of the tiny scientists, robot hijinks, zeppelin based coups, exorcisms, and one-sided naval cannon battles, *Nichijou* manages to be life affirming in a real and heartwarming way: no matter how crazy your life is, it's better to go through it with friends.  

If you liked the weird, check out *Lucky Star* or *Pop Team Epic*.  If you liked the slice of life, but wish it was a bit more normal, check out *K-On!* or *Watamote*.  Keichi Arawi also has an ongoing manga series called *City*.

*Nichijou* is available on Blu-Ray and streaming on Funimation!

# Something sad: A Silent Voice/The Shape of Voice
*A Silent Voice* (known as *The Shape of Voice* in Japan) is a drama film about how children are terrible.  The premise is that a young boy who relentlessly bullies a deaf girl - interestingly, played by a deaf voice actress - gets a chance later in life to make amends.  Drama ensues as teenagers are predictably cruel and stupid.  The movie gets real in weird ways, there's a scene involving bone anchored hearing aids that I have to skip on rewatches.  The movie has a very good sound track and also spawned an [excellent AMV](https://youtu.be/_QfPliSW83A).

If you liked the premise, but wish it had a bit more levity, check out *Love, Chuunibyou, and Other Delusions*.  If you want another drama movie, try *The Girl Who Leapt Through Time*.

*A Silent Voice* is available on Blu-Ray and streaming on Netflix!

# Something dark: Puella Magi Madoka Magica
I almost don't want to recommend this, because to mention it is to ruin it.  Don't Google it, don't think about it too hard, just watch it without spoilers.  Briefly, it looks cute; it is not.  It's got half the cast of *K-On!* (with Mio Akiyama appearing as herself), but this is a masterwork of actual monster Gen "Urobutcher" Urobuchi.  It is *not* for the faint of heart or for kids, but the payoff is excellent.  Watch it if you're having too good a time.  

If you want to check out Urobutcher's other work, take a look at *Psycho-Pass*.  If you want to watch an actual Magical Girl show, I've heard *Sailor Moon* is the place to look.  If you want something darker, take a look at *Made in Abyss*, but don't say you weren't warned.  If you need a palette cleanser, *My Neighbor Totoro* is good one.

*Puella Magi Madoka Magica* is available on Blu-Ray and for streaming on Hulu, Netflix, Crunchyroll, Funimation, and HBO Max!

# Something cute: Girls und Panzer
Cute in anime can mean either something adorable or something cheesecake-y.  Girls und Panzer is both, with an added dash of historical weapon fetishism.  Ostensibly a sports anime, GuP centers around Sensha-Dou - translated as "tankery" - in which high-school girls battle in vintage WWII-era tanks.  Each school has a different country whose style they ape.  St. Gloriana is a prim and proper British school where all of the characters are named after teas; Saunders is the insanely wealthy, utterly classless American school; so on and so forth.  The show has a cult following among internet Nazis (who love anything involving panzers) and general weapon nerds (who also love anything involving panzers), with a dash of people who are just in it for the many, many cute girls.  To preemptively answer the question, "Rosehip best girl, you're waifu a shit".

If you like the "cute girls and weaponry", I've heard *Uppote!* is good - the girls *are* the weaponry!  If you liked the girls, but not the weaponry, check out *K-On!*.  If you want something with more of an infantry focus, take a look at *Song of the Sky*.  If you were angry the Kettenkrad did not appear, please direct your attention to *Girls' Last Tour*.

*Girls und Panzer* is available on Blu Ray and streaming on Netflix, Hi-Dive (and thus VRV), and Crunchyroll!

# Conclusion
There are five shows, plus some leads on more to get you started.  Assuming I don't scour this post from the site because I develop standards, be on the lookout for a comprehensive review of bear anime.  If you were wondering, that's where Lain will show up.
