Hi!  My name is Sam, this is my blog.  I'm going to write about stuff.

### Janitoria
I work day to day as what I refer to as an "IT Janitor".  "Janitoria" is my term for anything related to system administration, user support, IT asset management, physical and cybersecurity, and other janitor related tasks.  My current work involves a lot of macOS administration and networking, so that'll be a lot of what I write about.

### Off topic
The other portion of this blog is "off topic".  This includes my interests like firearms, minimalism, anime, or science fiction, as well as random stuff that strikes my fancy.

### Schedule
All posts are "posted" at 5:55:55am (five is my favorite number (having a favorite number is perfectly normal (leave me alone))) on whatever day they're originally written on.  I use GitHub Pages for hosting, but because I **occasionally** edit them before posting, they might appear on days other than when they're posted.  This is because I'm lazy, not because the site or RSS feed is broken.

### Favicon
It's a trashcan, because I'm trash and so are you.
