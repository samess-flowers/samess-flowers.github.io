I have one request to make of the world: turn off your computer!  It's bad for the computer, it's bad for security, and it's just common sense.

### For your computer
If you have a laptop, especially if you take it home with you, turn off your computer.  When you stuff it in a bag, if it's on, you're damaging your computer.  Your average laptop can barely manage thermal load in ideal circumstances, let alone when it's trapped inside a cramped, sealed backpack or messenger bag.  Even if you're just closing the lid and leaving it on your desk (don't do that either), it's still not a great idea.  If you have to put it in a desk drawer, it better be turned off.

### For security
If you have a laptop, it **should** be using full disk encryption.  It doesn't matter if it's a home machine, encrypt the disk.  If disk encryption is turned on, your computer needs to be turned off.  When your computer is turned on the disk is unlocked.  Doesn't matter if it's BitLocker or FileVault.  If you're leaving your laptop on your desk at the end of the day (don't do that) or you have a desktop, there are far more options to get into it when it's on and decrypted.

Even beyond disk encryption, if your computer is on, it's probably on the network.  If you have a non-hardened OS, which you do because you're not using a server, being on the network is a liability.  You're not using it anyway, so there's no benefit.  There's the idea of overnight updates, which is decently valid in Windows but isn't a thing for macOS, because macOS updates are terrible.  For macOS, bluetooth is also enabled when it's asleep, which is annoying if you have a strictly monogamous bluetooth device and want to pair it to something else, and also annoying if you get pwned by someone because bluetooth is an open sore on your system.  God forbid someone Air Drops you something.  Do you know what turns off bluetooth?  Turning off your computer.

### For basic human decency 
This is where this is going to get weird: you should turn off your computer because you aren't using it.  If something isn't in use, it shouldn't be on.  You don't just leave the faucet running when you aren't using it.  It's a simple concept.  So turn your computer off.
